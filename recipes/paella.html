    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>The origins of paella are ancient, rooted in the area around Valencia, Spain near the Albufera Lagoon, where both fishing and rice growing dominated the region for centuries.</p>
      <p>Paella was the food of farm workers who cooked dishes of rice over wood fires, embellished with whatever ingredients they could find.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Prawns/Shrimp</li>
	<li>Mussels</li>
	<li>Calamari</li>
	<li>Other seafood options: clams and chunks of white fish will also work</li>
	<li>Paella Rice</li>
	<li>Onion</li>
	<li>Garlic</li>
	<li>Smoked paprika</li>
	<li>Chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>Chicken/Fish stock, seafood broth can also be used</li>
	<li>Salt and black pepper</li>
	<li>Lemon wedges</li>
	<li>Parsley</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the seafood:</strong>Peel and devein the prawns/shrimp then pat the shrimp and calamari dry with paper towels. Place a large, deep pan (approximately 11-12inches/30cm) over medium high heat. Drizzle the calamari and shrimp with olive oil and season with salt then sear in the hot pan until a little color develops but the seafood isn’t cooked fully yet. It’s important to dry the seafood well as this will help them brown in the hot pan. This step is also optional but I prefer searing the seafood first to ensure they don’t release too much moisture into the paella. Remove the seafood from the pan and set aside.</li>
	<li><strong>Start the Paella:</strong>In the same pan, heat the olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and cook until translucent and fragrant. Pour in the tomatoes and cook for a few minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated. Add the rice and smoked paprika and stir to combine. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
	<li><strong>Cook</strong>Pour in the stock then reduce the heat, partially cover and allow to simmer for 7 minute or until most of the liquid has been absorbed and the rice is almost cooked. Add the squid, calamari and shrimp, tucking it into the rice. Try not to disturb the bottom layer of rice. Cover again then cook for another 5-7 minutes until the seafood and rice are fully cooked.</li>
	<li><strong>Serve</strong>Season to taste and serve with lemon wedges and chopped parsley.</li>
      </ol>
