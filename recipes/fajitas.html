    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>chicken</li>
	<li>bell pepper</li>
	<li>onion</li>
        <li>lime juice</li>
	<li>spices</li>

	<li>your favorite toppings</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Season the chicken</strong>. Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it in.</li>
	<li><strong>Cook the chicken.</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium heat and lightly coat it with a drizzle of olive oil or avocado oil. Sear the chicken breasts for about 7-8 minutes on each side. Then remove them from the pan and let them rest for a few minutes before slicing into strips.</li>
	<li><strong>Saute the bell peppers and onion.</strong>While the chicken is cooking, cut the bell peppers and onions into thin slices. Then saute them in the same skillet over medium heat for a few minutes until caramelized. You’re essentially making fajitas veggies.</li>
	<li><strong>Mix together.</strong>Add the chicken back into the skillet, squeeze fresh lime juice on top and stir everything together.</li>
	<li><strong>Wrap it up.</strong>Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings.</li>
